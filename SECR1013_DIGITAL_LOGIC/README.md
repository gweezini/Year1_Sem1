Digital Logic course educates and brings insights to me about how electronic devices,which is computer to operates and it is known as fundamental of digital electronic.
These are mocules of Digital Logic:
1.Digital Logic Overview
2.Number Systems and codes
3.Logic Gates
4.Boolean Algebra and Logic Simplification
5.Combinational Logic Circuit
6.Functions of Combinational Logic
7.Latches, Flip-flops and Timers
8.Counters
For chapter 3 until chapter 6,I learn combinational circuit while chapter 7 to seven 8,I learn sequencetial circuit.
All of these are the bridges of software and hardware.
